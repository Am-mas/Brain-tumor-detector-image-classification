Dataset was from Kaggle
This model is created only for learning purposes. I sourced some codes from kaggle notebook and also from stack overflow. The model uses a pretrained model to train with the data. 
You can deploy the model via android using tensorflow lite but first create a .tflite file after running the project.
The dataset has around 7000 images and all the necessary cleaning has been done. Through augmentation the images are trained using different opacities.
